# Matrix-based CPU Benchmark #
### Inspired by Linpack HPL benchmark ###

## Contains two options: ##
* NumPy script (which requires numpy lib) <= Preferable
* SciPy script (which requires scipy lib)

### Warning: SciPy based scipt kinda buggy and produces many warnings (the warnings are already suppresed for visual) ###
