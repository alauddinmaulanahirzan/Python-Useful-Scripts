# Matrix-based CPU Benchmark #
### Inspired by Linpack HPL benchmark ###

## Contains two options: ##
* NumPy script (which requires numpy lib) <= **Run This**
    * Increase **the matrix size** as you wish
* SciPy script (which requires scipy lib) <= No Further Update, **Do not run**

### Warning: SciPy based scipt kinda buggy and produces many warnings (the warnings are already suppresed for visual) ###
